## Weather Application Using Expo React Native

Hi Future Developer!

This project is about the ease of building mobile applications using popular technologies such as React Native and Expo.

The application I developed utilizes Expo React Native and integrates with the OpenAPI WeatherMap, providing a solution that enables users to obtain real-time weather information from various locations worldwide. This application offers a simple yet user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily check current weather forecasts and long-term predictions. By utilizing the OpenAPI WeatherMap, this application leverages the latest and accurate weather data to present relevant information to users. Users can search for specific locations and view current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, current weather conditions, and long-term forecasts

Thank you for your interest. Happy coding!
